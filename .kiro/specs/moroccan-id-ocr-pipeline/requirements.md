# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive OCR (Optical Character Recognition) pipeline for processing Moroccan National ID cards (CIN) and Driver's Licenses using Google Document AI. The system will extract structured data from both front and back sides of these documents through a Next.js application with secure API routes, custom processors, and robust error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure Google Document AI authentication securely, so that the OCR pipeline can access Google Cloud services without exposing sensitive credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate that all required environment variables are present (GCP_PROJECT_ID, GCP_LOCATION, GCP_KEY_FILE, PROCESSOR_ID_FRONT, PROCESSOR_ID_BACK)
2. WHEN authenticating with Google Cloud THEN the system SHALL use service account JSON key file from environment variable path
3. IF any required environment variable is missing THEN the system SHALL log a clear error message and prevent OCR operations
4. WHEN handling authentication errors THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure API routes for document upload and processing, so that users can submit ID documents for OCR processing through a RESTful interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a document THEN the API SHALL accept multipart/form-data with image files (JPEG, PNG, PDF)
2. WHEN processing upload requests THEN the system SHALL validate file size limits (max 10MB per file)
3. WHEN receiving invalid file types THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes with descriptive messages
4. WHEN handling file uploads THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling for network timeouts and malformed requests
5. IF the upload exceeds memory limits THEN the system SHALL stream the file processing to avoid memory issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to process both front and back sides of Moroccan National ID cards, so that I can extract complete identity information from both document sides.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a front-side CIN THEN the system SHALL extract fields: full name, CIN number, date of birth, place of birth, and photo
2. WHEN processing a back-side CIN THEN the system SHALL extract fields: address, issue date, expiry date, and authority information
3. WHEN using custom processors THEN the system SHALL route front-side images to PROCESSOR_ID_FRONT and back-side images to PROCESSOR_ID_BACK
4. IF Document AI processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
5. WHEN extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON with all extracted fields and confidence scores

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to process Moroccan Driver's License documents, so that I can extract driving credential information from both document sides.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a front-side driver's license THEN the system SHALL extract fields: license number, full name, date of birth, license categories, and photo
2. WHEN processing a back-side driver's license THEN the system SHALL extract fields: issue date, expiry date, restrictions, and authority information
3. WHEN determining document type THEN the system SHALL automatically detect whether the document is a CIN or Driver's License
4. IF the document type cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL return an error with suggested document requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any OCR operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log the operation with timestamp, document type, and processing duration
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including Google Cloud error codes and messages
3. WHEN processing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL log extracted field counts and confidence score summaries
4. IF rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement proper backoff strategies and inform users of retry timing
5. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle memory constraints and provide appropriate user feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a test configuration endpoint, so that I can verify the OCR pipeline setup and troubleshoot configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the test endpoint THEN the system SHALL verify Google Cloud authentication without processing documents
2. WHEN testing processor connectivity THEN the system SHALL validate that both front and back processors are accessible
3. WHEN configuration testing completes THEN the system SHALL return a detailed status report of all system components
4. IF any configuration issues exist THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps in the response
5. WHEN running in production THEN the test endpoint SHALL require appropriate authentication or be disabled

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want optimized performance for production use, so that document processing is fast and reliable under normal load conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL complete OCR operations within 30 seconds for standard document sizes
2. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL process up to 10 simultaneous OCR operations without degradation
3. WHEN managing memory usage THEN the system SHALL not exceed 512MB per processing operation
4. IF processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates to prevent timeout issues
5. WHEN caching is beneficial THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching strategies for repeated document processing
