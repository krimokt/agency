# OCR Setup Complete! 🎉

Your Google Cloud Vision API integration is now ready to use. Here's what has been set up:

## ✅ What's Been Done

1. **Environment Configuration**: Added your Google Cloud Vision API key to `env.example`
2. **API Route**: Created `/api/ocr` for secure server-side OCR processing
3. **Document Parser**: Updated to use the API route instead of client-side processing
4. **Security**: API key is kept server-side for better security

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Create your `.env.local` file**:
   ```bash
   copy env.example .env.local
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if not done already):
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. **Test the OCR functionality**:
   - Go to `/clients` page
   - Click "Add Client"
   - In the Personal Information section, click "Parse Documents"
   - Upload Moroccan ID and driving license images
   - Click "Process Documents" to test OCR

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Document Upload**: Users upload ID and license images
2. **OCR Processing**: Images are sent to `/api/ocr` endpoint
3. **Google Vision API**: Server processes images using Google Cloud Vision
4. **Data Extraction**: Text is parsed using regex patterns for Moroccan documents
5. **Form Population**: Extracted data automatically fills the client form

## 🛡️ Security Features

- API key is server-side only (not exposed to client)
- File uploads are processed securely
- Error handling prevents API key exposure

## 📝 Supported Documents

- **Moroccan ID Cards** (CIN)
- **Passports** (for foreigners)
- **Moroccan Driving Licenses**
- **Languages**: Arabic and French text

## 🎯 Expected Output

The parser will extract:
- Personal information (name, gender, nationality, etc.)
- ID document details (number, dates)
- Driving license information (number, categories, dates)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If OCR doesn't work:
1. Check that `.env.local` has the correct API key
2. Verify the API key is valid in Google Cloud Console
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Ensure images are clear and readable

## 💡 Tips

- Use high-quality, well-lit images for best results
- Ensure text is clearly visible and not cut off
- Test with different document orientations
- The parser works best with official Moroccan documents

Your OCR integration is now complete and ready to use! 🎉
